# Fourier_Phase_Analysis_and_Reconstruction
This code is using Fourier Transform techniques to analyze and reconstruct images by using their phase and magnitude components. 
The question and solution shows the importance of the phase component in image reconstruction.

### Question
- Consider two images a and b:
    - Compute their Fourier transform and extract the magnitude and phase.
    - Visualize and compare the results for both images.
- Swap the phase components of the Fourier transforms of the two images while preserving the magnitude.
    - Reconstruct and display the new images.

This code uses two images:

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="images/cat.png" width="200"><br>
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="images/man.jpg" width="200"><br>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
